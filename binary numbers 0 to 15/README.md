# LED Combination Cycle Arduino Project

This Arduino project cycles through various combinations of four LEDs connected to an Arduino board. It is a great way to learn about digital output control and timing in Arduino programming.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- Breadboard
- 4 LEDs (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- 4 resistors (220 ohm)
- Jumper wires

## Setup

### Circuit Diagram

1. **Red LED** connected to pin 5 through a resistor.
2. **Blue LED** connected to pin 7 through a resistor.
3. **Green LED** connected to pin 9 through a resistor.
4. **Yellow LED** connected to pin 11 through a resistor.
5. Common GND connection for all LEDs.

## How to Use

1. **Connect your Arduino** to your computer via the USB cable.
2. **Open the Arduino IDE**.
3. **Load the provided code** into the Arduino IDE.
4. **Upload the code** to your Arduino board.
5. **Observe the LED sequence** on your breadboard.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all connections are secure and correct according to the circuit diagram.
- Check that the LEDs and resistors are not damaged.
- Verify that the correct COM port and board type are selected in the Arduino IDE.
